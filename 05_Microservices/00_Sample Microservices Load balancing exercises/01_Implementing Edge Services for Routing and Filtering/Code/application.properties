# Spring Cloud Gateway Routing Configuration
# This section defines how incoming requests are routed to backend services.

# Define the first route (index 0)
spring.cloud.gateway.routes[0].id=example_route # A unique identifier for this route
# The URI where requests matching this route will be forwarded.
# In this example, it forwards to the public example.org website.
spring.cloud.gateway.routes[0].uri=http://example.org
# Predicates define the conditions under which this route will be activated.
# Here, 'Path=/example/**' means any request path starting with '/example/'
# will be matched by this route. For instance, /example/hello or /example/users/123.
spring.cloud.gateway.routes[0].predicates[0]=Path=/example/**

# Logging configuration to help debug and monitor the Gateway's behavior
# Set logging level for Spring Cloud Gateway components to DEBUG for detailed logs
logging.level.org.springframework.cloud.gateway=DEBUG
# Set logging level for Reactor Netty (the underlying HTTP client/server used by WebFlux/Gateway) to DEBUG
logging.level.reactor.netty=DEBUG
# Set logging level for the application's root package to INFO
